title: Introduction to Programming -- Fall 2019
...

# Overview

Welcome! In this course, we have two main goals - to teach you the skill of programming and the art of computer science. Having the ability to write and understand simple programs has become increasingly more important. The concepts and principles you pick up in this class will give you the ability to take an algorithm or problem in your chosen field and write a program that will help you do your job quicker, easier, and more reliably.

## Swapping Labs and Waiting Lists

If you attempt to swap one section but not the other in SIS, expect to end up on the back of the waiting list for both sections
See the [FAQ](faq.html) for suggestions on ways around this.


## Final Exam Times

The final exam will take place on Friday, December 13, 7-10PM. The location is determined by which lecture section you are enrolled in (see table below). You must take the exam with your official lecture section.

Section |Instructor            |Place
--------|----------------------|-----------------------
1110-001|Ray Pettit            |McLeod 1020
1110-002|Craig Dill (12pm)     |Chemistry 402

### Final Exam Scheduling Conflicts

**If you have a *direct* conflict with our Final Exam**, you may sign up to take the exam during a make-up exam session. We have 3 dean-approved make-up exam times: 

- December 13 2pm-5pm, 
- December 13 9am-12pm, and 
- December 12 7pm-10pm. 

Any student who cannot take the exam during the regular-scheduled time but can take the exam during the December 13 2pm-5pm slot must do so. You may only take the exam during the December 13 9am-12pm time slot if you have conflicts for BOTH of December 13 7pm-10pm and December 13 2pm-5pm. You may only take the exam during the December 12 7pm-10pm slot if you have conflicts with all three of the other slots. (Sorry for the elaborate process, but this is the best process we could find that was compliant with all relevant university policies.)

If you will be taking the exam during a make-up session, **please complete this form by Friday November 22: <https://forms.gle/iuA8K8ppm3RUK5wE7>**.


# Other *Introduction to Programming* Offerings

<!-- reorganize -->

CS 1110 and CS 1111 are both "general" introductions to programming, providing an overview of topics suitable for all majors.
There are also other Introduction to Programming offerings at UVa:

CS 1112
:   Covers the same material as CS 1110/1111,
    but is organized based on the assumption that *none* of the students have any prior programming experience.
    By contrast, CS 1110 assumes *most* students have no prior programming experience;
    CS 1111 assumes *all* students do have prior programming experience.

Placement Test
:   If you have programmed before, you can likely place out of *Introduction to Programming* entirely.
    Placement tests are offered in the CS department offices (Rice 527); They may be taken between 9am and 3pm weekdays, no appointment is necessary.
    If you pass the placement test, we advise taking CS 2110 to expand your programming ability further.

<!--
Three other courses (CS 1120 and two different flavors of CS 1113) present a more mathematical-, scientific-, or engineering-focussed introduction to computing, but are not being offered this semester.
