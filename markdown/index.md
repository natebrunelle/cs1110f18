title: Introduction to Programming -- Spring 2019
...

# Overview

Welcome! In this course, we have two main goals - to teach you the skill of programming and the art of computer science. Having the ability to write and understand simple programs has become increasingly more important. The concepts and principles you pick up in this class will give you the ability to take an algorithm or problem in your chosen field and write a program that will help you do your job quicker, easier, and more reliably.

## Final Exam Times

The final exam will take place on Saturday, May 4, 7-10PM. The location is determined by which lecture section you are enrolled in. You must take the exam with your official lecture section.

Section |Instructor            |Place
--------|----------------------|-----------------------
1110-001|Nathan Brunelle       |Clark 107 and Clark 108 (see below)
1110-002|Craig Dill (12pm)     |Olsson 120

If you have a direct conflict with our Final Exam, the make-up time will be Sunday, May 5, 9am-12pm in Rice 130. To get permission to take the exam at the make-up time fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/u7PcNZRaQAwkMTGT8) by 11:59pm April 19.

Section 001 was given 2 rooms for the exam. To ensure that we have an equal number of students in each room, you have been assigned to a room based on your computing id. If the number in your computing id is even, you will take the exam in Clark 108. If it is odd, you will take the exam in Clark 107. For example, Prof. Brunelle's computing id is njb2b, so he would take the exam in Clark 108 since 2 is even.

## Swapping Labs and Waiting Lists

If you attempt to swap one section but not the other in SIS, expect to end up on the back of the waiting list for both sections
See the [FAQ](faq.html) for suggestions on ways around this.

# Other *Introduction to Programming* Offerings

<!-- reorganize -->

CS 1110 and CS 1111 are both "general" introductions to programming, providing an overview of topics suitable for all majors.
There are also other Introduction to Programming offerings at UVa:

CS 1112
:   Covers the same material as CS 1110/1111,
    but is organized based on the assumption that *none* of the students have any prior programming experience.
    By contrast, CS 1110 assumes *most* students have no prior programming experience;
    CS 1111 assumes *all* students do have prior programming experience.

Placement Test
:   If you have programmed before, you can likely place out of *Introduction to Programming* entirely.
    Placement tests are offered in the CS department offices (Rice 527); They may be taken between 9am and 3pm weekdays, no appointment is necessary.
    If you pass the placement test, we advise taking CS 2110 to expand your programming ability further.

<!--
Three other courses (CS 1120 and two different flavors of CS 1113) present a more mathematical-, scientific-, or engineering-focussed introduction to computing, but are not being offered this semester.
