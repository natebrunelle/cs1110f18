# Idea: loop through some collection and "accumulate" some stuff
# Start with "nothing"
# Repeat:
# 	"Add" something
# Done: Have it all


# integers - accumulate a sum



# integers - accumulate a product



# strings - accumulate all text







# add 1 item to a string
# add 1 item to a list
# add 1 item to a tuple
# add 1 item to a range



# add several items to a string
# add several items to a list
# add several items to a tuple
# add several items to a range



# # looking at collections ...
# string1 = "1234"
# tuple1 = (1,2,3,4)
# list1 = [1,2,3,4]
# range1 = range(1,5)
#
# my_group = [string1, tuple1, list1, range1]
#
# def collection_info(the_collection):
# 	print(type(the_collection), the_collection)
# 	for each in the_collection:
# 		print(type(each), each)
#
# print("my_group - ", my_group)
# for item in my_group:
# 	collection_info(item)

# There are lots of things that we can do with collections:
# create
# access an item - range of indexes, positive and negative?
# change an item value
# iterate (loop) through each item
# check if a given item exists
# find the length
# add an item
# remove an item
# join 2 collections
# copy the collection
