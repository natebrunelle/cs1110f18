# x = 20
# if (x < 10) and (x > 0):
# 	print("the and was true")
#
# if (x < 10) or (x > 0):
# 	print("the or was true")
#
# if not(x < 10):
# 	print("the not was true")




# x = 0
# if x < 5:
# 	print("small")
# elif x < 10:
# 	print("still kinda small")
# elif x < 100:
# 	print("not small at all")
# elif x < 1000:

# x = 500
# if x < 5:

# #  The print function that we've been using has several parameters with default
# #  arguments. The sep parameter assigns the value of the string that will be
# #  printed between the arguments. If not specified, this value is one space.
# #  The end parameter assigns the value of the string that will be printed
# #  at the end of the print statements. If not specified, this value is one a
# #  new line character. That's why print statements usually separate multiple
# #  arguments by spaces and move the cursor position to the next line.
# print("Hello1", end="\n\n\n\n\n")
# print("Hello2", end="")
# print("Hello3", end="")
# print("Hello4", end="")
# print("Hello5", end="!!!???\n")
# print("Hello6", end=".\n")
# print("Hello7")
# print("Hello8")
# print("one", "two", "three")
# print("one", "two", "three", sep="")
# print("one", "two", "three", sep="___")
# print("one", "two", "three", sep=" AND ")
# print("first", "! ", "second", "?", "third", sep='', end='')
# print("done")
