# This is how we do a comment in Python
# comments can be on their own line, like this one, or start at the end of a line
# eveything after the # character is ignored by Python
print("hello, world!")

print(2 + 4) # print the sum of the numbers 2 and 4

print("good morning") # this text is called a string .... str .... as in a string of characters
print(5 + 2) # the + (plus sign) operator performs addition when the operands are number values
print("first" + "second") # the + (plus sign) operator performs concatenation when the operands are string values;
                          # this should print out "firstsecond"
# prinnt("hi")   this line of code produces a syntax error; print is misspelled and Python doesn't recognize it
# print("5" + 2)  this line of code produces a semantic error; Python recognize all the pieces,
#                 but a string and a number can't be added together in Python
