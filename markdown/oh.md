Here's what you should and should not expect during office hours

You should Expect:

-   OH to take place in Thornton Stacks
-   Assistance from TAs on programming assignments and understanding class material

Please Do NOT Expect:

-   Immediate assistance upon arrival to Thornton Stacks
-   Due to student demand it might take a few minutes before a TA can work with you
