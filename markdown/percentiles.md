# Percentiles

The following is a list of exam scores by [percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile). 

If your score was above that listed in a particular row, you performed at least as well as the corresponding percentage of the class. Find the largest score less than or equal to your own to find your percentile.
For example, if my score on Exam 1 was 90.0%, I would find 90.0  in the Exam 1 column, which tells me I performed as well as or better than 47% of the class
