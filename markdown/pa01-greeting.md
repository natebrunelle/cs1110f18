# Task

Write a program called `greeting.py`.
When run, it should print out six lines of text.
The first should include your name;
the second should include something you'd like the course staff to know about you.
The final 4 lines should each complete the statements below (all these appear in the syllabus):

*Posts containing significant portions of the solution to assignments are _____ and will be penalized as such.

*You must write your own code. Not just type it (though you need to do that too): compose it yourself, as your own ____ work. 

*The ____ ____ is also where you see your grade and any feedback on it, and is also how you can submit a regrade request for an assignment.

*TA office hours are held in the ____ in Thorton A wing most days; a schedule will be released soon.

In addition to the code to print that information,
your `greeting.py` file should contain a comment with a *different* thing
you'd like us to know about you.
