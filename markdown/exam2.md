# The Exam

Exam 2 was given in class on Wednesday 3 April, 2019. The overall grades on this exam were lower than we expected. As a response to this, we are giving you the opportunity to give a wrap-up of your exam. Such reflections have proven to be effective in helping students to identify strengths and weaknesses in their study habits, and to plan for future exams.

# Wrapping-up the Exam Experience

On or before Friday 19 April, you may submit an exam wrapper^[See [the teaching commons](https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-talk/exam-wrappers) for a decent introduction to the idea of an exam wrapper.] to make up some of your lost points. This should be a plain-text document named `exam2wrap.txt` containing the following sections:

1. Preparation

    Reflect on how you prepared for the exam and how effective that was.
    Don't limit yourself to the days immediately before the exam; how effective were you approaches to learning the material as the semester progressed as well?

2. Errors
    
    List each mistake you made on the exam, and explain the correct answer.
    If possible, also explain why you answered incorrectly: what confused you?
    
    If there are questions you got right, but based on the wrong reasoning, explain those too.

3. Plans
    
    Wrap-up this exam experience by planning what you'll do differently in the future.

An example template might be:


```
Preparation
===========

I prepared for this exam by ...

I thought this was good/bad because ...


Errors
======

I missed Q3. The correct answer is ... because ...


Plans
=====

To improve my learning going forward, I plan to ...
```

If you do not submit a wrapper, your initial exam score will stand as your exam performance. If you do, that score can only go up, not down.
