# Alex Tomiak

I'm a second year in the eschool double majoring in computer engineering and math. I grew up on a farm in southwest VA, and taking CS1110 was my first time programming. I'm in InterVarsity and club running- I'm training for the Philly marathon in November!
Talk to me about CS, math, and EE classes, running (or any other sport), and your favorite shapes of pasta (fusilli with pesto is the best- change my mind).


# Alexander Monaco

Hey everyone! I'm a 3rd year CS and Music student in the College. In my free time, I enjoy composing songs and destroying my friends in Smash Bros.


# Anna Morse

Hi! I'm a third year double majoring in Computer Science and Philosophy. In my free time (which seems to be nonexistent this semester), I love cooking, yoga, running, concerts, fostering kittens, watching The Great British Bake Off, and hiking. If you have any cool trails or parks you've gone to, let me know!


# Brandon Ongtingco

Hello! I am a current 2nd year BSCS Major from Norfolk Virginia! Back home I work as a Lifeguard and Water Safety Instructor. On the side I am a Super Smash Bros. Ultimate competitor and very big on gaming. Fun fact about me, I am currently writing a book known as The Caerestra Chronicles which can be found on Wattpad!  


# Caroline Chen

I'm a second year studying Computer Science in the College! This is my first semester as a TA for 1110 and I'm excited to work with everyone. In my free time I like to play Pokemon Go and write! A fun fact about me is that I really like cats. 


# Clara Na

Hi! I'm a third year studying computer science and math. This is my third semester TAing for CS 1110/1111, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! If you happen to see me around Grounds outside of normal class hours, it'll most likely be around Old Cabell (where I play piano, including in a chamber ensemble) or at the AFC (rare, but possible).

Fun fact: I am very, very good at making music by clapping in front of my mouth.... In fact, I have never met anyone who is better at it than I am, probably at least partly because people generally avoid doing it in public since it's almost as annoying as whistling..... Feel free to ask for a demonstration, or better yet, challenge me to a mouth clapping duel..........


# Daniel Bevan

Hello! I'm a second year studying Computer Science and Music. I'd like to pursue a career where I am able to combine these two fields. In my free time I like to listen and dance to kpop music :) See you in lab!


# Daniel Kovach

Hello, I am a fourth year BACS major on the pre-medical track. I am involved with the PHE program at UVa, Lighting of the Lawn, and I volunteer at the UVa Hospital in the Infusion Clinic.

Feel free to ask me questions about the major, the computing industry, or even my interests in the healthcare field. 


# Danielle (Nelly) Zevitz

Hello! I am a 2nd year, and this class is the reason why I am a BACS major and not a Biology major! Quick plug: I'm in Marching band and Monroe Society. Catch me basically anytime on a MoWeFr or running from class to class on a TuTh, but NEVER in the morning.


# Danny Perkins

Hello! I am a third year BACS major on a pre-med track.  I am interested in exploring the field of data science and computing with biomedical application. I took my first CS course ever in my first semester at UVA. I found it fun and decided to major in it so I hope you enjoy the course as much as I did and still do. My fun fact is that I like to play Pichu in Super Smash Bros Brawl (although I get destroyed by my friends).

I play trumpet in the Cavalier Marching Band, used to dance and read a lot but generally don't have time anymore, and can't handle spicy foods. This is my second semester TAing for this class, and I'm really excited for the upcoming semester! They asked for a fun fact, so here goes: I have two bottles of shark's teeth that I've collected sitting on my desk at home.

# Quyen Huynh

Hi! I'm a second-year majoring in Computer Science in the College. I was born in DC and raised in Northern Virginia. I grew up around music - doing dance on and off for about 10 years and theater for 3. I also played the flute in the school band for 8 years. I'm also in the pilot program for CS, so if you have any questions about that, feel free to ask me! :)


# Samuel Wilkinson

I am a fourth year studying Cognitive Science, specializing in Neuroscience. I’m from Ashland, Virginia. In my free time (ha!...like that’s a real thing) I enjoy playing bluegrass music with my six siblings. My weird talent is breathing very heavily after I have walked up a flight of stairs. Talk to me about your thoughts on Freud, Roman political history, or the colonization of Mars. 


# Sean Gatewood

Hi! I’m a fourth-year CS major in the Engineering School. I had basically no programming experience before I took CS 1110, but this class was so much fun that it changed my major! 

I have interned at Uber ATG and NASA, and next year I’ll be working at {{sean.employer}}. I really enjoy getting outside, listening to old music, and playing with my labradors. This semester, I am learning to groove on the Djembe.


# Winston Liu

Hey there! I'm a fourth year from Morris Plains, New Jersey, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish. I like to keep active - I absolutely love rock climbing, and I also dabble with volleyball, badminton, soccer, basketball, hiking, running, and ballroom dancing. Need a rock-climbing partner or want to learn more about it? Look no further 😁. I'd love to talk to you about programming, the CS curriculum, life, TAing, residential colleges (go Hereford!), what it's like to desperately fast-walk between New Cabell and the E-School multiple times a day, or anything, really :).

Fun fact! I'm ambidextrous, memorize computing IDs after seeing them three-ish times, and have walked the last 200km of the Camino de Santiago!


# Yudel Martinez

I am a second year studying Computer Engineering. I was born in Cuba and now live in South West Virginia. I am involved in undergraduate research, the UVA Mechatronics and Robotics Society, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. I have done software and web development in the past and am excited to be TA-ing for CS1110.

A fun fact about me is that I wore a gorilla suit to the snowball fight on the lawn.
