I'm a second year in the eschool double majoring in computer engineering and math. I grew up on a farm in southwest VA, and taking CS1110 was my first time programming. I'm in InterVarsity and club running- I'm training for the Philly marathon in November!
Talk to me about CS, math, and EE classes, running (or any other sport), and your favorite shapes of pasta (fusilli with pesto is the best- change my mind).

Hi I am a fourth year Computer Science major with a Statistics minor. I had zero programming experience before CS1110, but it made me become a CS major and I couldn't be happier. In my free time I am on the Team Handball Club here on grounds and love to watch the Hoos play any sport. Fun fact about me is my birthday is Valentine's Day. Hope you all enjoy this class as much as I did! 


# Anna Morse

# Catherine Zhao

<img src=ta_images/f19/catherinezhao.jpg height="400" >


Hi there! I'm a second year from Centreville, VA majoring in biomedical engineering. CS 1110 was my favorite class that I took my first year and it's what led me to pursue CS minor. This is my first semester TAing for 1110. 

Outside of school, I'm involved in the Cavalier Marching Band (yay clarinets!), A.O.E. (the engineering sorority), SWE (the Society of Women Engineers), and XA (Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship). Fun(?) fact about me is that I am double jointed in my fingers. 


# Clara Na

Hi! I'm a third year studying computer science and math. This is my third semester TAing for CS 1110/1111, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! If you happen to see me around Grounds outside of normal class hours, it'll most likely be around Old Cabell (where I play piano, including in a chamber ensemble) or at the AFC (rare, but possible).

Fun fact: I am very, very good at making music by clapping in front of my mouth.... In fact, I have never met anyone who is better at it than I am, probably at least partly because people generally avoid doing it in public since it's almost as annoying as whistling..... Feel free to ask for a demonstration, or better yet, challenge me to a mouth clapping duel..........

Hey there! I'm a fourth year from Morris Plains, New Jersey, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish. I like to keep active - I absolutely love rock climbing, and I also dabble with volleyball, badminton, soccer, basketball, hiking, running, and ballroom dancing. Need a rock-climbing partner or want to learn more about it? Look no further 😁. I'd love to talk to you about programming, the CS curriculum, life, TAing, residential colleges (go Hereford!), what it's like to desperately fast-walk between New Cabell and the E-School multiple times a day, or anything, really :).

Fun fact! I'm ambidextrous, memorize computing IDs after seeing them three-ish times, and have walked the last 200km of the Camino de Santiago!


# Yudel Martinez
