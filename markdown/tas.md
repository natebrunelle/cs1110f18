I'm a second year BS in Computer Science major. At UVA I'm a member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and a code coach for CS 1110. When I'm not on grounds, you can find me in my hammock, out with my friends, trying out a new recipe, or playing tennis. A fun fact about me is that I own and can play over 20 musical instruments.

# Alexander Monaco

Hello! I am a second year student pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Music (as well as a minor in Astronomy, time permitting). I initially came to UVA to study Astrophysics but switched to the BACS after realizing how much I enjoyed Computer Science. In my freetime I enjoy practicing the piano and my vocals; eventually I plan to learn guitar and the erhu!

Hi!  I'm a fourth year studying CS and Statistics in the college. This is my fifth semester TAing 1110 and I'm excited for round five! I have held an internship with MITRE for the past two summers and I will be starting at Deloitte in the Fall! Outside of academics, I am heavily involved in UVA's Salsa Club and University Dance Club, and I love to travel. Please feel free to ask me about the BACS major, Salsa club, or the job recruitment process!

# Andrew Leon

I am from Ashburn, Virginia, but I was born in Florida. I am a 3rd year BACS major with a minor in Statistics. I took CS 1110 because I was interested in software engineering and ended up loving it enough to major in it. Two fun facts about me are that I am one of nine children and I’m a member of the UVA Handball Club Team.  

Feel free to ask me about any CS or STAT courses you’re interested in taking.

# Anna Morse

Hey!  I'm a second year double-majoring in CS and Philosophy. I'm from Annapolis, MD, and I have a pug at home named Biggie who I miss dearly. This is my first time TAing and I'm excited to see what the semester has in store! A fun fact about me is that I've section-hiked the Maine portion of the Appalachian Trail, and I'd really like to thru-hike the whole thing.

Ask me about hiking and Greek history (or CS), or feel free to send me advice on how to take a headshot because I don't have one (so here's my dog instead!).

# Annie Chapman

![](tas/AnnieChapman.jpg)

I'm a 2nd year BA Computer Science and Mathematics major. While I plan on going to medical school, I decided I didn't want to major in Biology or Chemistry and picked CS instead since its functional and applicable to many industries, and its fun too.. I'm a UVA research assistant for a project called NIST that is a cognitive assistant for EMTs and this summer I'm working for a manufacturing company in their data analytics department. A fun fact about me: I love to climb i.e. to boulder in a climbing gym and outside on real rocks.

Feel free to talk to me about CS classes, MATH/APMA classes, pre-med classes, or cool things in general.

# Caroline McNichols

![](tas/CarolineMcNichols.jpg)

I am a fourth year studying systems engineering. This is my 7th semester as a TA for 1110! My favorite activities at UVA are working with the Society of Women Engineers and being a part of the club gymnastics team. Other cool things I've done are being a fellow in the Meriwether Lewis Institute and interning at IBM. I'm excited to be moving to DC next year to become a technology consultant at Deloitte.

Feel free to ask me about systems, SWE, or MLI!

# Claire Veasey

I’m a second year in the College majoring in computer science and math. This is my second semester as a TA for CS 1110. Outside of school, I like playing and listening to music, playing with my dog, cooking, and writing (in order of my skill level).  
  
Fun fact: I’ve never had my lobes pierced, but last semester, I got curious and got a conch piercing.

# Conner Flannery

I’m a third year studying finance in the Commerce school. Although I’m not majoring in CS, I enjoy the subject and have taken classes up to CS 2150. I have been a TA since my second year, and it has been one of my favorite experiences at UVA. A fun fact about me is that I traveled to Australia on a J-Term class this past winter break.

# Layne Berry

Hi! I’m a Computer Science and Linguistics Major in the College, and I’ve been TAing CS 111x for three semesters now. My first year at the University, I took 11 different classes in 11 different departments--this course was fun enough it convinced me to major in the subject, so I hope you all have as good a time as I did. I can’t wait to meet all of you, in lab or in office hours, and especially to work on game projects, which are my favorite part of every semester. I have fostered over 40 kittens over the past decade--feel free to ask me for pictures!

# Mara Hart

I’m a first year, pursuing BS Computer Science. I’m from Virginia Beach. I didn’t seriously start learning programming until I got to UVA and I’m hitting the ground running. Besides a CS TA, I’m a photographer. My favorite things to shoot are portraits and candids. My plan for next semester is to be studying abroad in Shanghai where I’ll take business classes and be immersed in the Chinese culture!

Ask me about photography and OYFA at UVA!

Fun fact: I can name all 50 states in less than 20 seconds.

# Sean Gatewood

![](tas/SeanGatewood.jpg)

Hi!  I’m a third-year CS major in the Engineering School, and I love this class! I actually came to UVA dead-set on Aerospace Engineering, but then CS 1110 happened. Python is super fun, and I use it all the time to make cool little apps for myself. (My current project: an app to email me when I run out of socks.) My one goal for you this semester: Discover the magic in programming. I mean, it’s basically like Harry Potter; you just have to write the spells yourself! :-)

I also do work in atmospheric data management for Science Systems and Applications, Inc (SSAI). Talk to me if you are interested in CS in the aerospace industry! I might have some cool links for you.

# Vasil Zhigilei

![](tas/VasilZhigilei.jpg)

Hey! I am from Charlottesville and I am a first-year who has been a CS1110 TA for both semesters. I love programming, scuba diving, lifting, spending time outside, and hanging out with friends. If you're ever looking for a personal project to work on, let me know! I've got lots of ideas and not enough time.

# Viviana Rosas

![](tas/VivianaRosas.jpg)

Hey guys!  I am a second-year student pursuing a double major in computer science and Chinese. I took CS my first year to see what all the hype was about and ended up loving it. Last summer I had an internship at a start-up in Lisbon and this year I’m going to work at Microsoft in their AI team. An interesting fact about me is that I can speak 4 languages (Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Italian).

Feel free to ask me about CS2150, how to finesse buying textbooks/school supplies, Perú, AI, skydiving, and being first-gen :)

# Webster Thompson

I'm a third-year student pursuing a BA in CS and Philosophy. This is my third semester TAing CS1110. I grew up in New York City and spent my high school years in Concord, New Hampshire. I'm on the Men's Rowing Team, but am a passionate former hockey player and even more passionate current New York Rangers fan (tough rebuilding year I know). A fun fact about me is that I bicycled across the country in 2015 (Anacortes, Washington to Portsmouth, New Hampshire).

# Will Scheib

![](tas/WillScheib.jpg)

I am a first year from Virginia Beach. I plan to study Computer Science in the College. This is my first semester as a TA, so I'm just as new as you are! In my spare time, I do data analysis on sports (I know, I'm a nerd). Right now I'm working on an algorithm to predict March Madness. Feel free to ask me about it! I even did a week-long mentorship with the Pittsburgh Pirates before my senior year of high school.

# Yudel Martinez

![](tas/YudelMartinez.jpg)
