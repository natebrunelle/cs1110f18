# Overview

Giving a brief overview of the lab would be wise:

1.	You'll write one file with 9 functions in it
	-	It may also contain testing code, or you may put the tests elsewhere
	-	You might not get to all functions; that's OK
	-	You'll submit your file (and maybe a second file if you get to task 10)
1.	We haven't taught you everything you need
	-	But there is a "Tools to Use" section that does
	-	We want you to practice reading and applying on your own
	-	We will help, but we'll ask what you've already tried first...
1.	Read the writeup, then do the tasks
	-   (Suggestion: start them down the path for the first problem: bring it up, talk about it, scroll down to where the operators are described, let them loose)
	

# Helping

One goal is that the students learn some on their own.
Most questions should be answered with questions:

-	What have you already tried?
	-	Did that work?
	-	How do you know it (did/didn't) work?
-	Which tools do you think would work for this?
	-	How could you find out?
	-	Which ones have you tried already?
		-	I'd suggest trying a few...
-	Have you tried working out what it would do yourself using a pencil and paper?
-	Have you tried running it in <http://pythontutor.com>?

Followed by

-	Give that a go and see what happens.

Avoid the temptation to say "yes" or "no" when they ask if something will work.  Instead, "Try it and see."
