# Help us improve

We have a few studies ongoing trying to understand and improve this course.
It helps if we have some of your feedback.
If you didn't do so last week, please take a few minutes to fill out the survey linked below:

<div style="display:table;margin: 1em auto;font-size:150%; padding:1ex; border:thin solid #e3e3e3; border-radius:4px; background:#f5f5f5;-webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); -moz-box-shadow: inset 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); box-shadow: inset 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);" id="survey-link"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LighthouseECCS1110PostSurveyFall2019">Survey</a></div>

# Course Evals

There are evals for this course (and every other course you are enrolled in) in Collab.
As a general rule we only read the evals for lecture sections, so there is no obvious reason to submit evals for lab sections;
but we do read and value your lecture section feedback!

# Review Activity

## Quiz Game

Form up teams for the CS 1110 review quiz game!
Our quiz game tool is simple (so much so you have to use the right link for your room),
but it will let us review with a (hopefully) fun element of competition.

One (1) member of each team should go to the proper link for your lab Building:

> [Olsson 001](https://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/quiz/)
>
> [Olsson 009](https://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/olsquiz/)
>
> [MEC](https://stardock.cs.virginia.edu/mecquiz/)


# Game project

If the review quiz ends early, use what's left to work with your partner on the game project!
Office hours often overfill the last week of class, so this is your best chance of getting TA help on it too.
