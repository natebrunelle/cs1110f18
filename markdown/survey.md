# Informed Consent Agreement

**Please read this consent agreement carefully before you decide to participate in the study.**

**Purpose of the research study:** The purpose of the study is  to get an understanding of TA and student interactions during office hours and any biases that may be present.

**What you will do in the study:** If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to use a link to generate a random ID number and fill out a survey during lab today. The survey serves to provide background information about each student that can be used to determine if there is a perception of bias. You will use your ID number in place of your name or computing ID to fill out the survey and the consent form to ensure that all data stays anonymous.

**Time required:** The study will require about 10 minutes of your time.

**Risks:** There are no risks to participants in the study. If the data on my computer were compromised, only anonymized information could become known.

**Benefits:** There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study.  The study may help us understand perceived biases within student-TA interactions. Students interact with TAs on a much more regular basis than they do with professors, but these interactions have not received as much attention as faculty student interactions

**Confidentiality:** The study will also use information that Professor Tychonievich already has access to such as submission times, office hour queue usage, and student TA interaction surveys. Professor Tychonievich will link this information to your random ID and remove your name, computing ID, or any other identifying information before giving me access to it. I will filter out the information for consenting students based on the ID numbers on the survey.

Professor Tychonievich only knows which student corresponds to which number, and every student, regardless of whether or not they choose to participate, has an ID number generated for them. Therefore, he will not be able to determine which students chose to participate. I will match the number you enter in the survey to the anonymized information provided by Tychonievich. At no point will I know the names or computing IDs of participants, nor will Tychonievich or Dill know which students have chosen to participate.

Your number was generated randomly and is not correlated in any way to your name, ID, or anything else. Numbers were generated for all students, whether they chose to participate or not, so retrieving your number does not reveal any information to Tychonievich. No conclusions that are documented or published as a result of this study will contain any identifying information.

**Voluntary participation and Right to withdraw:** Your participation in the study is completely voluntary. You have the right to withdraw at any point in time, and deciding not to participate or terminating participation early will have no consequence on your access to course resources, your grade, or any other aspect of your experience in this or future courses. You are also free to leave any questions on the survey blank if you prefer not to answer.

**How to withdraw from the study:** If you begin the study but do not submit it, your responses will not be used. If you would like to withdraw after your response has been submitted, please fill out [this form](https://virginia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bsyAK515IwmlEZD) and input the random ID number you used before. If you forget the number, you can find it by returning to the site you used previously to generate the number. This will anonymously send me your ID number signaling that you would like to withdraw from the study. Your professor will not know that you chose to withdraw. Upon withdrawing from the study, your collected data will be destroyed.

**Payment:** You will receive no payment for participating in the study.

**Using data beyond this study:** The data you provide in this study will be reported in aggregate with no identifying information. Specific data will be retained in a secure manner by the researcher for one year and then destroyed.
